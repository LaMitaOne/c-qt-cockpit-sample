# c-qt-cockpit-sample
   
C++ Qt Automotive Cockpit Simulation sample
    
    
Status: 🟢 Learning Project discontinued but maybe someone can use it somehow   

This project was developed during the 4th week of a C++ and Qt training course 2022. It simulates basic vehicle physics, gear shifting logic, and dashboard interactions using QML.   
    
Features:     
    
     Motor control (Start/Stop logic).   
     6-Speed Manual Transmission simulation (Gear shifting logic).    
     Physics approximation (Friction, acceleration curves based on RPM).   
     QML Integration for UI.   
       
    
Tech Stack: C++, Qt Framework (QML, QQmlApplicationEngine).
